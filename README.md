### Imperial Calculator
An easy-to-use foot-inch calculator for Firefox.


The Imperial Calculator is an easy-to-use calculator that can perform basic mathematical operations on both foot-inch and numerical values. You can calculate the sum of multiple lengths, find the area of a room, and convert decimal feet to foot-inch values. The calculator's state is updated after each key press, ensuring proper input validation. Additionally, recent results for each calculation are stored in a history log so users can keep track of their work.


## Installation
You can install the latest version of the Imperial Calculator through the Firefox Add-ons page [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/imperial-calculator/).

The current version of the Imperial Calculator, v1.3, is compatible with Firefox 57+.


## Usage
Using the Imperial Calculator is fairly straightforward, but may be a little more complicated than a typical calculator due to the need to enter foot-inch values. Here's how to get started.


#### Entering Foot-Inch Values
- To enter *feet*, enter the appropriate value followed by the *FT* button.
- To enter *inches*, enter the appropriate value followed by the *IN* button.
- To enter *fractions*, click on the *NUM* button followed by the value of the numerator. Click on the *DEN* button, followed by the value of the denominator.

  Note that each of these buttons will be disabled until you press an operator button (+, -, /, *, or =). Additionally, the calculator will automatically place a 0 in any higher order position if one was not provided (i.e. 4" will read as 0' 4").

#### Converting Decimal Feet to Foot-Inch
- Enter the decimal foot value.
- Click the *FT* button.
- Click the *=* button.


#### Calculate Square Footage
- Enter the length of one side of a rectilinear space.
- Click the *X* button.
- Enter the length of the adjacent side of a rectilinear space.
- Click the *=* button.
  
  Note that all square footage values will automatically be given in decimal format.
  
 #### Find a Missing Length 
 
 - Enter a square footage in either decimal or fractional format. Do not use the *FT* or *IN* buttons.
 - Click the */* button.
 - Enter a known length in foot-inch format.
 - Click the *=* button.
